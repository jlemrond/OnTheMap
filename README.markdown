# OnTheMap

This app is designed as the third project in the Udacity iOS Development Nanodegree Program.

The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak.

**Features:**
+ Users Login to Udacity, or can be directed to the sign up page on Udacity's Website
+ The Data from the last 100 pins added to Udacity's Parse server are displayed in two formats, Map View and Table View.
+ When a user selects the annotation of a pin or an item on the table they are directed to the associated link.
+ Users can add their own pins to the Map and List, they are able to specify the locaiton of the pin and the web address associated with their post.
